Its main ingredients are flour, cinnamon, sugar, and butter, which provide a robust and sweet flavor.</p>

        <p>Finnish desserts are often simple, hearty, and made with fruits and berries that can grow in colder climates. They are also influenced by Russian and Eastern European cultures, and commonly served with nuts, cream, and berries.</p>
