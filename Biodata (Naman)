        <h2><u>About Me</u></h2>
<p> My name is Naman Chandra , and I am currently a first-year student pursuing a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Engineering. I have always been passionate about technology and problem-solving, which led me to choose this field of study.

    Apart from my academic interests, I have a few hobbies that keep me balanced. I enjoy listening to music, which helps me relax and stay focused during my study sessions. Cooking is another hobby I love—there’s something therapeutic about experimenting with new recipes and creating something delicious. Additionally, I have a strong love for traveling. Exploring new places, meeting different people, and learning about diverse cultures excites me and broadens my perspective.
    
    I’m looking forward to growing both academically and personally during my time in BTech, and I’m excited for the opportunities that lie ahead.
